# hello-world!
### This is my training repo on Git

I am Dmitrii, advanced experienced QA engineer aiming to upgrade skills in SW development:
- I will write private code;
  - I hope I can approve my PR's by myself.
- I will explore other's people public code if you don't mind;

What can I write here? Description, comments, commands?

I will test **bold** and *italic* text in markdown syntax.

Is it ***really important*** to format it like that?

    <html>
    
      <head>
      
        <title>My homepage</title>
        
      </head>
      
    </html>
