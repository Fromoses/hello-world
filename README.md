# hello-world!
### This is my training repo on Git

I am Dmitrii :man::aquarius:, advanced experienced QA engineer aiming to upgrade skills in SW development:
- I will write private code;
  - I hope I can approve my PR's by myself.
- I will explore other's people public code if you don't mind;

What can I write here? Description, comments, commands?

I will test **bold** and *italic* text in markdown syntax.

Is it ***really important*** to format it like that?

BTW some time ago I've been writing an HTML pages with just hands
    
    <html>
    
      <head>
      
        <title>My homepage</title>
        
      </head>
      
    </html>

May be you'll like [my personal website](https://moiceev.ru) content - it's on modern CMS already. It is not about coding.

**Behavior Driven Development** approach - does it benefits?

In my work I am pretty accurate to mark if:
- [x] test passed or
- [ ] test failed

How do I see the Kanban workflow as a developer:

| Type:package: | Designed | In progress | Done |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Feature | To Do | In Development | Implemented |
| Defect | Reported | In Development | Fixed |


#### Code looks much prettier, when syntax is highlighted :camera:
```json
{
  "firstName": "Dmitrii",
  "nickName": "Fromoses",
  "age": Err
}
```
